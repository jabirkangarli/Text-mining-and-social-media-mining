The project is prepared by Daria Ivanushenko and Jabir Kangarli for the Text Mining and Social Media Mining subject at the University of Warsaw. 

The dataset contains 20.000 reviews from Tripadvisor. We implement sentimental analysis and topic modeling methods to see if our dataset provides any useful insight for us. 

Please either upload the data and two images to your working directory before running the Rmd file or find it in attached data folder.
